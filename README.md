# CLARIAH-DE_dibilit

DiBiLit is a corpus being created in the BMBF-funded project
CLARIAH-DE by homogenising various derivatives of texts from the
"Digital Library" and extensively enriching them with
(bibliographical) metadata. The more than 2,000 texts come from
renowned authors, are DTABf-encoded and were made accessible within
the DTA infrastructure under a Creative Commons-licence. Thus, the text
collection originally published by DirectMedia Publishing can be
researched using the DDC search engine integrated in the DTA as well
as other DTA tools for linguistic analysis.

The repository contains different directories:

- publications `[contains the documentation of the workflow]`
